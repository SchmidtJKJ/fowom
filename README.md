this forum is part of a website I am trying to build using bare PHP and MySQL for back-end
The whole story is that I am building a web application that will have a forum, a news part were people in my inner circle can send me article that I will publish for them
It conntains statisic, lives score, perdiction, comments on articles likes and other stuff.
I just graduated from college with a B.A. in CS I wanted to do something useful and, as a big fan of soccer, this idea came up.
This web application is in Haitian Creole, Most of the variable names are as well but are kinda easy to figure out
